Machine Learning Approach towards Cyberbullying Detection on Twitter
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Cyberbullying detection using various pre-processing, vectorization and machine learning algorithms.

Pre-processing methods - Stemming, Lemmatization, Removal of stop words, Removal of words occuring once

Vectorization methods -  CountVectorizer, TF-IDF, Word2Vec and BERT

Machine Learning Algorithms - SVM, ADA Boost, Random Forest Classifier, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)



Various Experimental Setups
---------------------------

1) Countvectorizer with SVM, ADA Boost and Random Forest Classifier

2) TF-IDF weighted Word2vec with SVM, ADA Boost and Random Forest Classifier

3) Word2Vec with LSTM 

4) Word2Vec with CNN and LSTM

5) BERT with CNN

Best model is found to be BERT with CNN. An illustration of the model is developed in https://github.com/amalalexa/Cyberbullying_Web_Application
